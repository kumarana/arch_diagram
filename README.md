# arch_diagram

# Getting Started
It requires Python 3.9 or higher, check your Python version first.

It uses Graphviz to render the diagram, so you need to install Graphviz to use diagrams. After installing graphviz (or already have it), install the diagrams.

Install Grpshqiz from here https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/
